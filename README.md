## Description
This resource implements a voting system for FiveM servers, allowing players to vote for candidates (parties) via an in-game UI. It supports candidate management, voting permissions, vote tracking, and result display. The resource is designed to work with multiple frameworks (qbx_core, qb-core, es_extended, ox_core) and uses OxLib for UI and notifications.

## Features
**Voting UI**
- Displays a list of candidates with images, names, and party names.
- Allows players to select a candidate and cast their vote.
- UI can be opened/closed via in-game interactions.

**Candidate Management**
- Add Candidate: Admins can add new candidates via an input dialog (Character ID, Party Name, Party Image).
- Remove Candidate: Admins can remove candidates from the list.
- Candidate Data: Stored and managed server-side.

**Voting Logic**
- Vote Casting: Players can vote for a candidate. Each player can vote only once.
- Vote Counting: Votes are incremented for the selected candidate.
- Duplicate Prevention: Players who have already voted are notified and prevented from voting again.

**Permissions & Controls**
- Voting Booths: Configurable locations where players can access the voting UI.
- Control Panels: Admin panels for managing voting state, permissions, candidates, and clearing data.
- Permission System: Restricts voting and admin actions based on player job/group.

**Voting State Management**

- Permission Setting: Admins can set or clear required permissions for voting.
